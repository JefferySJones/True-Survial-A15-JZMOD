-Added New Wound Buff System-
-Anything that can attack you has a chance to hurt you. Get hurt too much and you will be wounded. To heal the wound you will have to treat it and maintain it until it heals. This wound system has 5 stages. 
-The first is Bruised and needs no tending to or maintaining it will heal on its own as long as you are not hurt more.
-The Second is a Small Wound. When you receive enough damage to get a Small Wound you will also get a Pain Buff that can be cured with a Pain Killer. To Heal the Small Wound you need to use a Bandage on it. After some time the bandage will get dirty and need reapplied. Do all of this successfully and your small wound will heal into Bruised. Fail to keep the wound clean or receive to much more damage from attackers and it will progress to a Wound.
-The Third is a Wound. When you receive enough damage to get a Wound you will also get a Sprained Leg Buff that can be cured with a Splint. To Heal the Wound you need to use a First Aid Bandage on it. After some time the First Aid Bandage will get dirty and need reapplied. Do all of this successfully and your Wound will heal into Small Wound. Fail to keep the wound clean or receive to much more damage from attackers and it will progress to a Sever Wound.
-The Forth is a Sever Wound. When you receive enough damage to get a Sever Wound you will also get a Gash Buff that can be cured with a Suter Kit. To Heal the Sever Wound you need to use a Sanitized Bandage on it. After some time the Sanitized Bandage will get dirty and need reapplied. Do all of this successfully and your Sever Wound will heal into a Wound. Fail to keep the wound clean or receive to much more damage from attackers and it will progress to an Infected Wound.
-The Last stage is an Infected Wound. When you receive enough damage to get an Infected Wound you will also get an Infection (not the Z Virus) To Heal the Infected Wound you need to use a Sanitized Bandage on it. After some time the Sanitized Bandage will get dirty and need reapplied. Do all of this successfully and your Infected Wound will heal into a Sever Wound. Fail to keep the wound clean and you will die.
-New Bite System- 
-Getting bitten and not caring for it is the only way to get the Z Virus. Infected can only Bite you if they Grab (stun) you. Once you receive a Bite you will also get a Bleed that can be healed as normal. To remove the Bite you must cook a Metal/Steel Pipe in the Campfire/Burn Barrel and Cauterize the Bite with it. You have 24 game hours to do this before you catch the Z Virus. After you Cauterize the Bite you will have a Bite Wound that you will need to treat with a Bandage. After some time the bandage will get dirty and need reapplying. Do all this successfully and you will receive a Wound, fail to do any of these steps and you will be infected with the Z Virus.

-Apples Trees produce 1-6 apples and 1 seed per apple and Corn Stalks produces 3 Corn and 1 seed per Corn (Fertilizer will increase plant production)
-Fixed Carrots would not grow
-We will be keeping the traders. But money has no value in True Survival. The only thing of value in True Survival is something that will keep you alive. Bullets! Or Bullet Casings to be exact. I chose this because no player starts with the recipe and no player can craft it in their back pack. And it is the most complex part of modern ammunitions. So pick up your casings.

-Added chance to find a Turd in Birdsnest
-Rethink on Gun Smithing-
-A15 gave us the Combine Feature that took the place of your Gun Part Upgrade System. This changes how our Gun Smithing works greatly. Where before we found crap parts and improved them to level Gun Smithing now we will need to find better parts and repair (lower the quality) to level Gun Smithing. So I have increased the quality range on all Gun Part drops from (1-50) to (1-350). With perks that make the highest quality drop possible a quality 500. So the player will need to use the Combine to get quality 600 parts/guns.
-Did a pass through what the Traders can sell. I think we will use the Trades like the place you can go if you are having ???? luck on a drop you need. It will be expensive but if you can’t find it anywhere you should be able to get it at a trader. I will need help setting prices so and suggestions on item prices are welcome.
